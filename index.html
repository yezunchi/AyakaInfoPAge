    <h2 style="background-color:aqua">Character Design</h2>
    <ol>
    <b><li"><b>Appearance</b>: Ayaka's hair is styled into two braids that are looped outward before wrapping around her head. The chin-length locks of hair framing her face have one white flower on each side above her eyebrows and are tied at ear-level with white-trimmed blue accessories that each have one blue butterfly ornament stuck on top. There are white flowers on her braids. Ayaka also wears a hat decorated with two orange flowers on the left side.

        Ayaka wears a coat-like light blue open dress with a dark corset over a white petticoat with white sleeves and a faint silver gradient. The open dress's design includes lightly-colored lines seen elsewhere in Inazuma and has general gold accents as well as gold accents in the shape of sakura flowers, and the petticoat has the Kamisato Clan crest faintly patterned at the bottom. The dress also has a white collar and a pink bow on the left shoulder. At the back of her dress are gold-tasseled purple ribbons with the Kamisato Clan crest as well as a large blue bow styled to look like a blue butterfly, with her Vision in the center. Ayaka also wears a ring with a small blue butterfly ornament on her right middle finger. </style></li>

<h2 style="background-color: yellowgreen;"> How to use her in-game</h2>
    
    Now, I'm sure you would like to know, (if you have Ayaka) how to build her. Well, look no further because im going to tell you my personal advice, as someone who has a maxed out ayaka with c2 and best capability, how to build her to her strontgest.
    <ol>
        <li> Her ascension. I think its worth it to ascend her to at least level 80, for huge damage. Here are some materials you will need</li>
    <img scr= "Ascension.webp" class="img" alt="Ayaka build">
    <li> The best weapon for her by far is the <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Mistsplitter_Reforged">mistsplitter reforged</a></li>
    <li>The best artifact set for her is easily the blizzard strayer. For main stats, you want ATK%, cryo DMG bonus and crit rate or crit damage depending on how your substats are.<h2>&#128512;</h2></li>
